Regan AI Chatbot can understand two languages, Indonesian and English, though its Indonesian is very bad, which I prefer to talk by English only.
To switch the reply mode, you can use prefixes:
- "!" prefix for English replies. Example: !hello, what's up?
- "-" prefix for replies in Indonesian. Example: -halo, apa kabar?
